/// DCD file reader and writer
///
/// The DCD format was originally introduced by CHARMM, and is now used mainly
/// by NAMD. A lot of different analysis software supports it, making it widely
/// used in the bio-molecules community.
///
/// This format is based on fortran's unformatted binary I/O. Each call to
/// `write` in fortran produces a record marker containing the size in bytes of
/// the field, followed by a binary dump of the data, and then the record marker
/// again. Nowadays, record markers are 32-bit most of the time, but gfortran
/// (and maybe others) have an option to use 64-bit markers, and they were the
/// default at some point. The record data and markers are written using the
/// current machine endianness, forcing us to read both little and big endian
/// versions of this format.
///
/// This implementation is able to read a wide variety of variations of this
/// format, including:
///
/// - files created on little & big endian machines, without having to convert
///   the file first to the current machine endianess
/// - files with fixed atoms
/// - files with 4D dynamic
/// - multiple conventions for the unit cell: `a, gamma, b, beta, alpha, c` with
///   the angles stored in degrees or as the cosine of the angle; as well as the
///   full unit cell vectors (this is only used by CHARMM, starting with version
///   22).
///
/// When writing, this format uses a native endianess file, always outputs the
/// unit cell (infinite unit cells being represented with 0), and uses a 3D
/// format without any fixed atoms.
